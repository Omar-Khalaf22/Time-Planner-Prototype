# Time-Planner-Prototype
This is the (**unfinished**) code of an app that creates to the user his/her own personalized plan for either a day or a week (user's choice).

Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour cycle. Identifying a user's circadian rhythm will provide us with information about the user's variables (like productivity, creativity, etc.) throughout the day, which well help create a personalized plan that fits the user.

-Programming Languages used in the production of this app: Java (main language), XML(a language extremley cimilar to CSS for design), and some SQL to save permanent information into the phone's local memory
