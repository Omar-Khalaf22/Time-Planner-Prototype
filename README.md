# Time-Planner-Prototype
This is the (unfinished) code of an app that creates to the user his/her own personalized plan for either a day or a week (user's choice). After extensive research, I have created an algorithm (almost done, just needs some final edits) that taps into the user's Circadian Rhythm and incorporate it to the user's plan to optimize his/her day. Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour cycle. Identifying a user's circadian rhythm will provide us with information about the user's variables (like productivity, creativity, etc.) throughout the day, which well help create a personalized plan that fits the user.
